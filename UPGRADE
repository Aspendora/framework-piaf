- cd /usr/src/ :: change to your /usr/src directory
- rm -rf FreePBX :: remove your current FreePBX directory (if you have one)
- tar -zxvf FreePBX-version.tar.gz :: extract the new FreePBX tar
- cd FreePBX-version :: change to the FreePBX directory
- amportal start :: If asterisk is not already started
- ./install_amp :: run the upgrade script
